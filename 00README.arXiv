00README for arXiv processing
=============================

Main file: Henkel_DEST_2026.tex
TeX engine: pdflatex

This submission includes the LaTeX source and figure files referenced by the paper.
Paths to figures are relative to the submission root (no absolute paths).
All file names use only [A-Za-z0-9_+\-.,=] as required by arXiv.

Notes
-----
- If a .bib file is provided, arXiv will run BibTeX/Biber; otherwise a generated .bbl is included.
- No nonstandard fonts or shell-escape are required.
- Mixed figure formats are avoided. Prefer PDF/PNG/JPG for pdflatex; EPS only for latex -> ps -> pdf.
