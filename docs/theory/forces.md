# DEST Forces — v0.1

All “forces” are geometric responses of EM loops under the drift/actualize law and Θ‑curvature; no extra fields are added.

## Electromagnetism (native)
Integer EB + continuous direction; **charge = loop winding**; Coulomb/induction from orientation and EB circulation.

## Gravity (emergent)
**Θ(x)** as action tick density; sustained Θ induces **effective metric** `g^eff` (redshift, bending, time dilation).

## Strong (nuclear binding)
**Multi‑loop confinement** in shared Θ wells; loops phase‑lock (coupling `C=⟨cosΔφ⟩`); separation cost rises; explains compact proton, deuteron binding, jet breakup.

## Weak (decays)
**Loop unlocking + topology reconfiguration**; neutron → proton + electron + **n=1** drift packet (neutrino analogue); short range from deep Θ overlap.

## Predictions
Orbitals & Δ(mode) lines (Zeeman‑like via anisotropic Θ); τ(n) hierarchy; pair counts (3+3)≫(2+4)>(1+5); coupling plateaus & unlock thresholds; ray bending/redshift vs designed Θ.
