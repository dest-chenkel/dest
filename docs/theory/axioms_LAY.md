**Plain English:** each tiny spot tracks whole‑number dials for electricity/magnetism, effort counters, and an arrow for direction. Small local fixes spend one **action‑token h**. The smallest electric step is **one‑third of e**.

- **Glide (drift)** = gentle adjustments; **Reshape (actualize)** = local fix that costs one token.
- **Θ** measures how often we had to fix things; more Θ → more bending (gravity‑like).
- **Charge is a pattern**: a stable object is a three‑piece ring; mirror ring flips the sign.
- **Light packets** are labelled by **n**; **n=3** is first truly stable.

**Reading tips:** ΔS=h → “spend one action‑token”; Θ → “how much local reshaping per distance”; 3‑anchor loop → “three electric chunks make a stable ring”.
