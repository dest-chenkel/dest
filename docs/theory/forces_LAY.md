- **EM:** built‑in rules; loops carry a twist (charge).
- **Gravity‑like:** where **Θ** is high, paths curve and time changes pace.
- **Strong‑like:** loops **lock together** in a shared Θ‑well; hard to pull apart.
- **Weak‑like:** loops **unlock and re‑pattern**; a tiny **n=1** packet carries away leftovers.

**Reading tips:** Θ → “how much local reshaping per distance”; locking score → “how well loops stay in step”; unlocking → “re‑pattern with a small packet flying off”.
